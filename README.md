## Summary/Languages
The Tech Blog is an app that utilizes APIs, CRUD and introduces us to Handlebars and the MVC (Model-View-Controller) model. 

This assignment is missing several aspects and is not complete. For example, new user signup and login/logoff function as requested, however, comments, and updating posts have not yet been completed. Deleting a record does work.
